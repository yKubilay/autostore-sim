# Autostore Warehouse Simulator üè≠ü§ñ

A Go-based simulator where virtual robots navigate a 3D warehouse grid in real time.

Started to **explore Go's concurrency** and build scalable backend systems. Planning to expand with **Docker, GCP, and monitoring**.

The **frontend** uses **React** with **shadcn/ui** components to visualize the robots and grid.

## Key Concepts Explored
- Concurrency & parallelism in Go
- Collision handling & route optimization
- Real-time coordination between multiple agents

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Work in progress, continuously learning and improving.
