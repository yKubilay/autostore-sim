# AutoStore Warehouse Simulation - System Architecture

## Overview
This document describes the architecture of the AutoStore warehouse simulation system, built with Go backend and React frontend.

## System Architecture

### API - External Interface

### SERVICES - Business Logic

### MODELS - Data Structures

## Component Responsibilities

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Layers

**Entry Point**
main.go: System orchestration, service initialization, goroutine management, lifecycle control

**Models (Data Layer)**
- Warehouse: Thread-safe 3D grid with collision detection and inventory tracking
- Robot: Autonomous units with channel-based commands and realistic AutoStore timing
- Order: Customer requests with priority levels and comprehensive status tracking
- Product: Auto parts inventory with categories, specifications, and storage positions
- Workstation: Delivery endpoints for order completion and port management

**Services (Business Logic)**
- ProductService: Product catalog management, JSON loading, warehouse placement, inventory operations
- OrderService: Complete order lifecycle, robot assignment, status tracking, automated generation
- WarehouseService: Robot operation coordination, movement control, delivery management

**API (External Interface)**
- Handlers: REST endpoints for robots, orders, and system status with full CRUD operations
- Gin Server: HTTP router serving JSON responses on port 8080 with middleware support

### üîÑ Key Data Flows
- **Order Processing**: API ‚Üí OrderService ‚Üí Robot Assignment ‚Üí Warehouse Operations
- **Product Management**: JSON Catalog ‚Üí ProductService ‚Üí Warehouse Placement
- **Robot Operations**: OrderService Commands ‚Üí Robot Channels ‚Üí Warehouse Updates
- **Status Monitoring**: All Components ‚Üí API Responses ‚Üí Frontend Display

### ‚ö° Real-time Features
- **Goroutine-based Robots**: Each robot runs independently with channel communication
- **Thread-safe Operations**: Concurrent access to warehouse grid with mutex protection
- **Realistic Timing**: Based on actual AutoStore specifications (3.1 m/s horizontal, 1.6 m/s lift)
- **Automatic Order Generation**: Continuous order creation for demonstration purposes

### üéØ Design Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between data, business logic, and API layers
- **Concurrency Safety**: Thread-safe operations for multi-robot simulation
- **Realistic Simulation**: Based on actual AutoStore warehouse specifications
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new features and integrate with frontend
